#### Notes on Contribution:

OASP is organized in a way that it is easy for you to contribute. Therefore we have chosen to use github - the number one platform for social coding - which provides lean processes and great tooling.

In order to contribute code we use git and github pull-requests. Lead developers can directly commit to the git repository while (later) everybody can clone and fork the repository and create pull-requests. These can be reviewed, commented and discussed and finally integrated (or rejected).

We are very happy to receive contributions from community members, students, universities. Before you invest your time and work into a larger change or contribution please get in contact before to ensure you will not waste your energy (somebody else might already work on the same thing, etc.). To get in touch and discuss with us please use github issues and write a mail.
