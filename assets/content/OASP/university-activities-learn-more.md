OASP attracts students and university-teams to take advantage of OASP as open and simple CSD-platform that is close to the industry.

#### Rationale to start university activities on OASP
OASP is a strong basis for university activities that want to be close to the industry and benefit from relevant industrial experience with CSD software architecture. Besides, it has the following advantages:

- Open source software and documentation free to use
- Publicly hosted software and running server
- Provided guidelines on architecture and technology are highly relevant for Future job-opportunities
- University activities can expect some extra support from the OASP community
- Opportunity to network and integrate with other university activities and Build upon each others results
- Possibility to receive additional material regarding OASP (like preconfigured IDE or training material)

In general, the existing platform enables to start on advanced topics in the field of engineering, architecture, methods and tooling.

#### Examples for University activities
OASP is and has been used to engage in a number of activities by students or student teams for a practical semester, a graduate thesis or even a internship. A few examples:

- Graduate thesis to integrate SAP Hana as backend of a CSD application and to evaluate advanced use-cases like predictive analytics. A PoC is created based on OASP4j.
- A group of students creating a mobile frontend on the interfaces of the OASP4j server.
- Graduate thesis on enterprise monitoring in modern application landscapes evaluating a range of approaches and tools.

#### Cooperation with universities internationally
Currently we are cooperating with a number of universities that take OASP as architecture blueprint for modern CSD-applications to be used in classes and practice courses.

- Chair for the innovation on software development at University of Valencia
- Class for software engineering at University Darmstadt
- Practice course at University Kaiserslautern to build a mobile client on OASP
- Practice course at University Cologne to build advanced web client features for OASP
- Practice course at University Darmstadt to enhance OASP-restaurant with special attention on usability

#### Interested in using OASP?
f you are interested in starting your own graduate-activity on the grounds of OASP please get in touch. We would be quite happy to receive your application.

If you don't have a distinct idea what to do, just let us know your field of interest, so we will be happy to suggest a topic.
